# 🎮 Abby Jump

Abby Jump is a 2D Unity game where you guide **Abby** through obstacles, jumping over pillars anddd facing suprises while getting a high of a score as possible.  
Built in **Unity 2022.3.62f1 (LTS)** and written in **C#**, this project is designed to be lightweight, clean, and simple for me & you to learn from.
(Inspired By Wuthering Waves)
